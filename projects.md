# **Projects**

This section presents my major engineering work across cloud, automation, security, AI, and enterprise systems.  
Each category contains real-world automation frameworks, architectural patterns, and end-to-end systems I've built.

---

# 🚀 **1. Agentic AI Automation & Distributed Knowledge Intelligence (DKI)**

### **Building Autonomous, Reasoning-Driven Operational Systems**

I design agentic automation frameworks using **n8n**, **Tines**, and **Cursor**, enabling multi-step reasoning, autonomous execution, adaptive decision-making, and continuous validation.

These pipelines power real-world operations:

---

## **🔹 AI-Driven User Access Review Engine (UAR/UAC)**

A fully automated review workflow integrating:

- Active Directory  
- DFS Share Permissions  
- Finance/Compliance access policies  
- Slack approval workflow  
- Automated evidence dumping  
- n8n reasoning nodes for decisioning  

This system eliminates manual audits and enforces consistent policy adherence.

---

## **🔹 Agentic Remediation Pipelines**

Using n8n + Cursor:

- Conditional logic determines root cause  
- Automated remediation steps executed via AAP, SSM, or Azure Runbooks  
- Slack notifications with evidence & before/after snapshots  
- Integrated human-in-the-loop fallback  
- Audit-ready outputs stored in central repository  

---

## **🔹 Automated AI Usage Governance System**

Using Google Apps API + SCIM + n8n:

- Provisioning/deprovisioning for Cursor, Lovable, ChatGPT  
- Usage analytics extraction  
- Budget monitoring  
- Anomaly detection  
- Slack summaries for leadership  

---

## **🔹 Tines SOC/Compliance Automation Stories**

- Alert triage automation  
- Zero-touch ticket creation  
- RBAC validation workflows  
- Approval routing  
- Tenable/CrowdStrike health correlation  
- Slack intelligence delivery  

---
