Hi, I'm **Rohan Dutta**, a Senior Systems Engineer (Level 4) at Avalara Technologies. I lead vulnerability remediation and infrastructure security initiatives across a large-scale multi-cloud environment.

As the Vulnerability Remediation Lead, I oversee efforts to secure thousands of backend systems supporting Avalara's core tax engine infrastructure. I’ve built and maintained dashboards across Wiz and Tenable to track vulnerability reductions, SLA adherence, and severity categorization across environments. My work enables real-time classification of vulnerabilities into OS-level and application-level, ensuring teams can act with clarity and speed.

I manage a team of three engineers and specialize in automation of recurring remediation workflows using GitLab CI/CD, Terraform, and Ansible Automation Platform (AAP). I’ve led initiatives to automate tasks like SSMS updates, speculative execution mitigations, .NET Core/ASP.NET runtime upgrades, and CrowdStrike sensor performance validation. We develop and test our Ansible playbooks in isolated AWS dev environments before promoting to production.

I’ve also delivered projects that integrate Ansible workflows with ServiceNow to automate server provisioning and deprovisioning via Terraform, complete with pause/resume logic for approvals. I support secure automation around Okta security group creation, patch baselines using AWS Systems Manager, and tagging policy enforcement in Azure across subscriptions.

On the Azure side, I manage VM infrastructure and compliance tagging at scale. I’ve supported the migration of LCS-hosted Dynamics 365 F&O environments to UDE hosted in Power Platform Admin Center, including setup, tool installation, Azure VM provisioning, and metadata sync with Visual Studio.

My mission is to reduce manual toil and maintain strict compliance through intelligent automation and reliable infrastructure as code.
