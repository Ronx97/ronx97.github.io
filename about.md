## About Me

I am an AI-focused Automation Systems Engineer (L4) specializing in designing, scaling, and operationalizing intelligent automation ecosystems across complex multi-cloud environments. With 6+ years of experience and a strong drive toward engineering leadership, I build systems that go far beyond traditional scripts or pipelines — I design **agentic, autonomous, self-correcting operational frameworks** that reduce effort, increase resilience, and elevate the maturity of enterprise infrastructure.

My work combines **cloud-native architecture**, **Ansible Automation Platform**, **serverless engineering**, **agentic AI**, and **zero-touch operations** to solve real-world challenges across IT, Security, Compliance, Finance, and Engineering.

## Agentic & AI-Driven Automation Philosophy

I strongly believe in the future of **agentic Ops** — systems that not only automate actions, but understand context, reason about next steps, and continuously optimize themselves.

I use:

* **n8n agentic workflows** (custom nodes, branching logic, Google App integrations)

* **Tines automation stories for security, incident response, and governance**

* **Cursor + ChatGPT (Thinking Models)** for code generation, orchestration patterns, infrastructure design, and self-correcting automations

* **Event-driven AI workflows** tied to serverless infrastructure (Lambda + EventBridge)

* **Dynamic decision trees** for complex workflows: RBAC governance, vulnerability lifecycle, AD group management, UAR/UAC reviews

These agents act as "automation operators" that monitor systems, take corrective action, escalate decisions, validate compliance, and maintain audit trails — all without manual involvement.

## Real-World Automation Systems I Architect

### 1. Multi-Cloud Serverless Automation

I build end-to-end autonomous automation engines integrating:

* **AWS Lambda + EventBridge**

* **Azure Automation Runbooks + Schedules**

* **Azure Functions + Event Hub ingestion**

* **Hybrid SSM + Ansible Orchestration**

* **GCP API Integrations**

Workflows include:

* Scheduled start/stop policies

* Automated security baselines

* Credential rotation

* Multi-cloud tagging compliance

* Snapshot lifecycles & backup governance

---

### 2. Large-Scale Patch, Validation & Compliance Automation

I maintain automated patch governance across **500+ Windows & Linux systems** using:

* **AWS Systems Manager (SSM)**

* **Ansible Automation Platform**

* **Azure Update Manager**

* Hybrid activations and dynamic baselines

Complete with:

* Pre/post patch health checks

* Event-driven validation

* Slack reporting with CSV artifacts

* SLA compliance scoring

* Auto-remediation workflows

---

### 3. Enterprise Security Automation

I design agentic workflows for:

* **CrowdStrike & Tenable agent rollout**

* **Daily delta validation of sensor health**

* **Tenable SLA-based vulnerability tracking**

* **SCIM-based user lifecycle automation (Okta, AI tools, Microsoft services)**

* **Azure Defender for Cloud → EventHub continuous export**

* **Weekly UAR/UAC workflows for finance, AD, DFS shares**

Every workflow integrates auditability, Slack notifications, dashboards, and root-cause correlation.

---

### 4. CI/CD + Policy-as-Code + Infrastructure Automation

I build Terraform-based cloud frameworks that support:

* Multi-cloud VPC/VNet design

* Reusable modules for patching, lifecycle, monitoring

* Azure tenant-root governance

* Policy-as-Code pipelines for security baseline enforcement

* Automated resource provisioning & teardown

* GitLab/GitHub-based continuous compliance checks

---

### 5. LCS → UDE Migration & Lifecycle Automation

I have led Avalara's strategic transition from **Dynamics 365 LCS to Unified Development Environments (UDE)**:

* UDE provisioning in Power Platform Admin Center (PPAC)

* Automated Azure backend resource setup

* Developer VM provisioning with network policies

* Cost-optimized environment lifecycle management

* Metadata sync, schema provisioning, and workspace management

This is a large-scale modernization effort that required tight orchestration between Azure infra, Dataverse, and Dynamics 365 developer tooling.

---

## Leadership & Strategy

I lead a team of **four engineers (L3/L2)** across automation, patch governance, vulnerability management, SLA compliance, and infrastructure modernization.

I own:

* Engineering strategy for automation maturity

* Solution architecture for cross-team workflows

* AI tooling roadmap & cost governance

* Sprint planning, prioritization & execution

* Training the team on agentic automation concepts

My role blends **technical depth** with **operational leadership**, enabling me to mentor engineers while contributing to architecture and long-term strategic planning.

## What I Love Solving

✔ Highly complex, multi-step workflows that require reasoning

✔ AI-based orchestration across cloud, IT, and security systems

✔ Automating what was historically "un-automatable"

✔ Protecting time for engineers by eliminating manual work

✔ Designing systems that run *themselves*, not systems humans must babysit
