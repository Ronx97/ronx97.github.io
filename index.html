  <!-- TITLE -->
  <h1>Cloud Solutions Architect (L4)</h1>
  <h2>Multi-Cloud (AWS • Azure • GCP) • Automation Engineering • Agentic AI Systems</h2>

  <!-- INTRO -->
  <p>
    I design and architect large-scale, automation-driven cloud platforms across <strong>AWS</strong>, 
    <strong>Azure</strong>, and <strong>GCP</strong>, specializing in <strong>agentic AI workflows</strong>, 
    <strong>zero-touch cloud automation</strong>, and <strong>high-resilience operational systems</strong>.  
    My engineering approach focuses on building distributed, event-driven automation frameworks that eliminate manual work, 
    enforce governance, and operate reliably at enterprise scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work blends <strong>cloud architecture</strong>, <strong>security automation</strong>, 
    <strong>AI-driven orchestration</strong>, <strong>infrastructure-as-code</strong>, and 
    <strong>lifecycle engineering</strong> to create systems that <em>think, act, validate, and self-correct</em>.
  </p>

  <!-- SECTION: AGENTIC AI AUTOMATION -->
  <h2>Agentic AI Automation & Distributed Workflow Systems</h2>
  <p>
    I build intelligent automation engines using <strong>n8n</strong>, <strong>Tines</strong>, and 
    <strong>Cursor</strong> to execute complex, multi-step workflows across cloud, identity, finance, security, 
    and IT operations. These workflows integrate reasoning, branching logic, cross-platform APIs, and 
    self-validation patterns to deliver real-world autonomous automations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples include AI-powered User Access Reviews (UAR), automated DFS/AD permission audits, security posture insights, 
    Slack intelligence pipelines, continuous configuration validation, and adaptive remediation workflows.
  </p>

  <!-- SECTION: MULTI-CLOUD -->
  <h2>Multi-Cloud Architecture & Infrastructure Automation</h2>
  <p>
    I architect modular, secure, and scalable infrastructures using <strong>Terraform</strong> and 
    <strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong> to manage compute, networking, directories, security baselines, patch workflows, 
    and lifecycle automation across AWS, Azure, and GCP.  
    My automation-first architecture ensures consistency, observability, governance, and cost-optimized operations.
  </p>

  <!-- SERVERLESS -->
  <h2>Serverless Architecture & Distributed Automation Pipelines</h2>
  <p>
    I build event-driven pipelines using <strong>AWS Lambda</strong>, <strong>EventBridge</strong>, 
    <strong>Azure Runbooks</strong>, and native schedulers to orchestrate 
    lifecycle automation, resource governance, compliance checks, snapshot workflows, 
    backup/restore orchestration, and multi-environment operations.
  </p>

  <!-- SECURITY AUTOMATION -->
  <h2>Security, Vulnerability & Compliance Automation</h2>
  <p>
    My work includes automated deployment and validation of <strong>CrowdStrike</strong> and <strong>Tenable</strong> 
    agents, SLA-driven vulnerability remediation systems, Azure 
    <strong>Defender for Cloud → EventHub</strong> continuous export pipelines, enterprise RBAC enforcement, 
    and compliance workflows integrated with ServiceNow, Jira, Slack, and SOC operations.
  </p>

  <!-- PATCHING -->
  <h2>Patch, Lifecycle & Operational Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    I automate patching for hundreds of Windows and Linux systems using 
    <strong>AWS SSM Patch Manager</strong>, <strong>Azure Update Manager</strong>, and 
    <strong>Ansible Automation Platform</strong>. My frameworks include full pre/post patch validation, 
    event log analysis, service integrity checks, performance baselining, snapshot governance, and 
    complete compliance reporting pipelines.
  </p>

  <!-- AI GOVERNANCE -->
  <h2>AI Governance, Usage Management & Compliance</h2>
  <p>
    I manage enterprise-wide governance for AI platforms including <strong>Cursor</strong>, 
    <strong>Lovable</strong>, and <strong>ChatGPT</strong>.  
    Responsibilities include SCIM-based provisioning, auditing, usage forensics, dashboard analytics, 
    cost governance, access reviews, budget enforcement, and anomaly detection across teams and business units.
  </p>

  <!-- DYNAMICS -->
  <h2>Dynamics 365 Lifecycle Engineering (LCS → UDE)</h2>
  <p>
    I lead deployment, modernization, and automation of Dynamics 365 F&O environments, transitioning from 
    <strong>LCS to Unified Development Environments (UDE)</strong> in PPAC.  
    This includes Azure backend automation, metadata sync, workspace orchestration, 
    VM lifecycle optimization, and CI-driven environment governance.
  </p>
