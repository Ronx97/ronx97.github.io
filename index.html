  <h1>Rohan Dutta</h1>
  <p><strong>AI-Focused Automation Systems Engineer (L4)</strong></p>
  <p>Kolkata | <a href="mailto:rohandutta0609@gmail.com">rohandutta0609@gmail.com</a></p>
  <p>I architect intelligent automation ecosystems that transform how enterprises operate. With 6+ years of experience across multi-cloud environments, I specialize in building <strong>agentic, autonomous systems</strong> that eliminate manual work, enforce compliance, and scale infrastructure operations. My work spans AI-driven automation, serverless architectures, policy-as-code, and zero-touch operations — enabling teams to focus on innovation rather than maintenance.</p>

  <h2>Who I Am</h2>
  <p>I'm a systems engineer who thinks like a product architect. I don't just write scripts — I design <strong>self-correcting operational frameworks</strong> that understand context, make decisions, and continuously optimize themselves. My automation philosophy centers on <strong>agentic workflows</strong> using Tines, n8n, Cursor, and ChatGPT to create systems that reason, adapt, and operate autonomously.</p>
  
  <p>I lead a team of four engineers at Avalara, where I've built automation systems managing 500+ instances across AWS, Azure, and GCP. My solutions integrate deeply with enterprise platforms (ServiceNow, Jira, Okta, GitLab) to create seamless, auditable, and governance-ready workflows.</p>

  <h2>What I Specialize In</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Agentic AI Automation:</strong> Tines, n8n, Cursor, ChatGPT-driven workflows that reason and self-correct</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-Cloud Infrastructure:</strong> AWS, Azure, GCP — from serverless (Lambda, EventBridge) to hybrid orchestration</li>
    <li><strong>Ansible Automation Platform:</strong> Modular playbooks, hybrid activations, vulnerability remediation at scale</li>
    <li><strong>Policy-as-Code & CI/CD:</strong> Terraform modules, GitLab pipelines, automated compliance enforcement</li>
    <li><strong>Security & Governance:</strong> RBAC automation, UAR/UAC workflows, SCIM integrations, vulnerability lifecycle management</li>
    <li><strong>Enterprise Integration:</strong> ServiceNow, Jira, Okta, Tableau, Azure Defender, EventHub — end-to-end orchestration</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Impact Highlights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Implemented automated patching and post-patch validation across AWS and Azure, reducing manual maintenance effort for Infra team by over 60%</li>
    <li>Designed and led agentic automation workflows for vulnerability management, access reviews, and ServiceNow ticket handling</li>
    <li>Built reusable Ansible Automation Platform job templates and workflows powering Windows and Linux patching, CrowdStrike validation, and AD group lifecycle</li>
    <li>Partnered with FinOps and product teams to tag, track, and optimize multi-cloud costs across AWS and Azure estates</li>
    <li>Led LCS → UDE migration program, modernizing Dynamics 365 development environments with automated Azure resource provisioning and lifecycle management</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>Leadership & Philosophy</h2>
  <p>I believe in leading by example. Having been hands-on with every aspect of what we build — from infrastructure provisioning to automated remediation, CI/CD, and compliance — I understand not just the "what" but the "how" and "why" behind engineering decisions. This enables me to set realistic expectations, provide technical guidance, and mentor engineers based on real experience, not theory.</p>
  
  <p>My approach blends <strong>technical depth</strong> with <strong>operational leadership</strong>. I architect solutions that are strategically aligned, operationally transformative, and built to scale — both the systems and the teams that maintain them.</p>
